## Source for Karl's lectures

These are the source files for [Karl](http://kbroman.org)'s lectures
for the [SISBID workshop on Reproducible Research](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sisbid2017/modules/BD1703).

There's a [`Makefile`](Makefile) for constructing the PDFs, which are
placed one level up.

There's are mostly based on lectures from Karl's
[Tools for Reproducible Research](http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR) course.
